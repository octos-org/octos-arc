# Octos Failure Modes Inventory

Living catalogue of how the runtime handles each class of failure.
Update this file whenever a new failure class is discovered or an
existing recovery path changes.

## Conventions

- Each row is a single observable failure class.
- "Trigger" is the smallest reproducible signal (error code, log line,
  protocol event) that the failure has occurred.
- "Recovery path" names the runtime component that owns the response
  and the PR/milestone where it shipped.
- "Tested?" links to a test name (or notes a gap).
- "Owner" is the stewarding workstream — usually the originating
  engineer, sometimes a long-lived module.

## Adding a new failure class

When a new class is discovered:

1. Add a row above with the trigger, recovery path (or "TBD"), and a
   test reference.
2. If recovery is missing, file an issue and link it from this table.
3. After the recovery ships, update the row in the same PR.

This file is the canonical surface area for failure-mode reviews. Skip
no rows — silent partial coverage is what M8.9 was created to close.

| Provider quota exhausted (HTTP 402 / 429-with-billing-marker / 403-with-quota-marker) | `API error …: 402 quota will reset when the current 7-day window ends` (k3, 2026-08-26/27 burn) | #27b: `HarnessError::Quota` → `RecoveryHint::SwitchProvider` → `LoopDecision::RotateAndRetry` — the loop advances the ProviderChain to the `llm.fallbacks` slot and retries (chain advance in `RetryProvider::should_failover`, `LlmErrorKind::Quota => true`). Was `FailFast`/Escalate: the fallback slot never fired and recovery meant hand-editing profile JSON. | `harness_errors::tests::quota_switches_provider_but_401_stays_fail_fast`, `loop_state::tests::quota_rotates_lane_but_auth_escalates` | #27b (R6a) |
| True authentication failure (HTTP 401 invalid/expired key) — RED LINE | `API error …: 401 invalid api key` | `HarnessError::Authentication` → `RecoveryHint::FailFast` → Escalate. A wrong key fails identically on every fallback lane; this contract MUST NOT loosen to retry/rotate (pinned by the #27b test pair). | `quota_switches_provider_but_401_stays_fail_fast` (auth arm), `quota_rotates_lane_but_auth_escalates` (auth arm) | #27b |
| Malformed tool-call arguments (model emitted un-parseable JSON args) | `StreamError::MalformedArgs` from the stream layer (streaming.rs:396) | #27d (R4): loop_runner feeds the diagnostic back to the model as a user message (budget 3 per TURN, cumulative across tools — same defect); the stream layer keeps MalformedArgs NON-retryable (#1355 invariant, detection.rs pinned tests untouched). On budget exhaustion the pre-existing terminal path fires. Was: first MalformedArgs killed the whole turn instantly (instant death for a background task with no next turn). | `loop_runner_tests::malformed_toolcall_feedback_lets_model_self_correct_and_survive`, `malformed_toolcall_feedback_exhausts_and_terminates` | #27d (R4) |
