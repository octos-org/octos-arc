  def install
    # The release bundle ships `octos` alongside its 8 skill binaries
    # (news_fetch, deep-search, deep_crawl, send_email, account_manager,
    # voice, clock, weather). At `octos serve` startup, bootstrap discovers
    # those skills as SIBLINGS of the resolved `octos` executable
    # (current_exe().parent()). Keep all of them together in libexec and
    # expose only `octos` on PATH.
    libexec.install Dir["*"]
    # Use an exec WRAPPER, not bin.install_symlink: on macOS,
    # std::env::current_exe() returns the *symlink* path (Darwin
    # _NSGetExecutablePath), so a bin/octos symlink would put exe_dir at bin/
    # and the sibling skills (in libexec) would not be found -> plugin_count=0.
    # `exec` replaces the process image, so current_exe() == libexec/octos and
    # exe_dir == libexec, where the skill binaries live.
    (bin/"octos").write <<~SH
      #!/bin/bash
      exec "#{libexec}/octos" "$@"

    # `Pathname#write` does not set the executable bit, so the wrapper — the only
    # `octos` on PATH — must be chmod'd or `octos` fails with permission denied.
