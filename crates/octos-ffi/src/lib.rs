//! octos-ffi: a C-ABI surface for embedding octos in non-Rust hosts.
//!
//! This crate builds a `cdylib`/`staticlib` so Python (ctypes/cffi), Node
//! (ffi-napi/koffi), Go (cgo), or plain C can drive an octos [`Agent`] without
//! linking Rust. It wraps the same provider-construction and agent loop the
//! `octos` CLI uses (see `octos-cli/src/commands/chat.rs`), trimmed to a
//! one-shot task runner plus an optional embedder.
//!
//! # SAFETY
//!
//! The whole crate opts out of the workspace-wide `deny(unsafe_code)` with a
//! crate-level `#![allow(unsafe_code)]` because an FFI boundary is unsafe by
//! nature — it dereferences pointers it did not create and hands out owned
//! allocations across an ABI. Unlike `octos-sandbox` (two localized unsafe
//! blocks, so it uses per-fn `#[allow]`), essentially every function here is at
//! the boundary, so the allow is crate-scoped. Every unsafe operation is still
//! individually justified with a `// SAFETY:` note. The invariants the whole
//! surface upholds:
//!
//! * **Panics never cross the boundary.** Every `extern "C"` body runs inside
//!   [`std::panic::catch_unwind`]; a panic becomes a NULL/error return, never
//!   an unwind into C (which is UB).
//! * **Pointer discipline.** The runtime handle is an opaque `Box::into_raw`
//!   pointer freed only by [`octos_runtime_free`]. Every pointer argument is
//!   NULL-checked; C strings are validated as UTF-8 and rejected otherwise.
//!   Returned strings are `CString::into_raw` and must be freed ONLY by
//!   [`octos_string_free`] — freeing them with `free(3)` or double-freeing is
//!   the caller's UB, documented in `octos.h`.
//! * **Error reporting.** Failures set a thread-local last-error string,
//!   readable via [`octos_last_error`] until the next FFI call on that thread.
#![allow(unsafe_code)]
// The functions below are the C-ABI boundary: they intentionally accept raw
// pointers (the whole point of the crate) and validate them at runtime rather
// than being marked `unsafe fn` — the spec keeps them callable as plain
// `extern "C"` symbols. Silence the clippy lint that would otherwise flag every
// boundary function; each still NULL-checks before any dereference.
