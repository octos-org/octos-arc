//! octos-fleet-worker — the closed, non-interactive fleet task worker.
//!
//! This crate is the executor half of the fleet kernel (see `octos-fleet`
//! for the durable store). It provides:
//!
//! - [`build_fleet_worker_registry`] — the **closed** replay-safe tool
//!   registry (the crux: a worker that provably cannot park or fan out);
//! - [`run_attempt`] — the per-attempt executor that runs one plan task
//!   under a hard deadline, gates it on acceptance criteria, and records
//!   the real outcome to the [`octos_fleet::FleetKernelStore`];
//! - [`FleetWorkerPool`] — the bounded pool that launches a ready task and
//!   runs its attempt under global + per-fleet concurrency permits.
//!
//! It deliberately does NOT own the pool lifecycle, consume the outbox,
//! wake the keeper, or expose any LLM tool — those land in later PRs.
//!
//! # The sandbox is the boundary (not the tool list)
//!
//! The closed registry is a *denylist* of tool names — it removes parking,
//! fan-out, and network *tools*. It is NOT a network or process boundary: the
//! surviving `shell` can still reach the network (`curl`, `wget`, a non-force
//! `git push`) and can still detach a child via arbitrary shell-internal
//! backgrounding (`sleep 600 & true`, `sh -c "cmd &"`) that string inspection
//! cannot catch. Both are bounded only by the **sandbox** and its process-group
//! /container teardown, which is why [`AgentFactory::new`] requires an explicit
//! sandbox factory (no silent no-op default) and production MUST supply a
//! network-isolated sandbox — an operator requirement the API cannot enforce at
//! the type level (a no-op sandbox is flagged with a `tracing::warn!`).
//! [`AgentFactory::for_testing`] is the only no-op path and is gated behind
//! `cfg(test)`.
//!
//! # Deadline enforcement
//!
//! [`run_attempt`] wraps the agent run in a hard [`tokio::time::timeout`],
//! [`AgentFactory`] clamps the agent's per-tool timeouts to the deadline, the
//! worker shell also carries a hard per-command CEILING at the deadline (so a
//! foreground command cannot outlive it even if the LLM requests a larger
//! `timeout_secs`), the string-detectable background vectors are refused, and
//! the acceptance phase is itself bounded by the remaining deadline. The
//! residual: a child detached by arbitrary shell-internal backgrounding, or a
//! tool task the agent loop detaches on its own timeout, is reaped only by the
//! sandbox's process-group teardown — not by this crate.
