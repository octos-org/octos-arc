//! Module 2 — `run_attempt`: the per-attempt executor.
//!
//! It receives an already-launched `attempt_id` (the pool launches; this
//! runs it to a recorded terminal state) and:
//!
//! 1. CASes the attempt `Leased/Launching → Running` — a `Superseded` outcome
//!    is a lost race (`Aborted`), a store `Err` is infra (`RecordError`);
//! 2. builds a [`Task`] from the task's brief + acceptance criteria;
//! 3. mints a fresh closed-registry [`octos_agent::Agent`];
//! 4. runs it under a HARD [`tokio::time::timeout`] (the agent loop has no
//!    internal wall-clock deadline);
//! 5. maps the result to an [`AcceptanceVerdict`] — a timeout/infra-error is
//!    `Terminated`, a `success:false` stop is `Rejected`, a `success:true`
//!    run is gated on acceptance (`Accepted`/`Rejected`);
//! 6. records the real outcome + snapshot to the store, then unblocks
//!    dependents.
//!
//! # Known v1 limitations (documented, not yet fixed)
//!
//! - **Token under-commit on non-success paths (P2-2).** A timeout or infra
//!   error drops the [`octos_core::TaskResult`], so its [`TokenUsage`] is lost
//!   and the attempt commits `0` tokens against the fleet budget (see
//!   [`Computed::terminated`]). Upstream `turn_state` also does not fold
//!   `reasoning_tokens`, so even a committed count can under-report. This is a
//!   soft-budget v1 limitation (kernel spec §6): the budget is advisory, so an
//!   under-commit only weakens admission pressure, never correctness.
//!   Best-effort usage capture on the timeout path is a possible follow-up.
//! - **`split_whitespace` argv for `CommandExit` (P3).** A `CommandExit`
//!   verifier's command is split on whitespace into program + argv with NO
//!   shell, which is injection-resistant but quoting-naive: `test -f "out
//!   file.txt"` splits into four tokens and would falsely reject. Acceptance
//!   commands must use un-quoted, whitespace-free argv tokens for v1.
//! - **`FileExists` confinement is point-in-time (TOCTOU, P2).**
//!   [`check_file_exists_confined`] resolves + containment-checks the path
//!   (`canonicalize`) and then `metadata`s it as two separate syscalls; a
//!   concurrent writer could swap an in-workspace file for an external symlink
//!   between the two, and `metadata` would follow it. This is acceptable ONLY
//!   under v1's single-writer-per-task-workspace assumption: the confinement is
//!   a point-in-time check, not a race-proof absolute guarantee against a
//!   hostile concurrent mutator of the task's own workspace.
