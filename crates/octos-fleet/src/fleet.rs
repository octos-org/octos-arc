//! `Fleet` — the ergonomic plan-management API over [`FleetKernelStore`].
//!
//! PR 1 shipped the store: individual, revision-/generation-/lease-fenced
//! CAS ops (`create_fleet`, `create_plan`, `add_child`, `launch_child`,
//! `complete_child`, `replan`, …). This module composes those primitives
//! into whole-plan operations a keeper reasons over — **without changing
//! the store's CAS semantics**. It is still standalone: no LLM, no
//! `octos-agent`, unit-testable against a tempdir redb.
//!
//! ## One source of truth per fact (the PR-2 reconciliation)
//!
//! [`PlanTask`] is the **spec** (`task_id`, `title`, `detail`, `deps`,
//! `acceptance`); a task's **live state** is its child's
//! ([`FleetChildRecord::status`] + `current_attempt_id`) and its
//! **outcome + evidence** live with the child's
//! [`FleetChildRecord::outcome`] (the [`AcceptanceVerdict`]). [`Fleet::view`]
//! *joins* the two back together for rendering; it never persists a second
//! copy of the live state.
//!
//! ## What `Fleet` deliberately does NOT wrap
//!
//! `launch_child` / `mark_running` (the executor's job in PR 3) are left on
//! the store and reached via [`Fleet::store`]. `Fleet` owns *plan
//! management* — create, view, readiness, edits, outcome recording — not
//! attempt execution.
