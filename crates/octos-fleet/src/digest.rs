//! # The controller digest — a bounded read over the finding log
//!
//! The goal feature's failure mode is not a missing executor. It is that the
//! controller's context window becomes the ceiling on problem complexity: if
//! synthesising progress means reading what every worker did, the architect
//! degrades into a clerk relaying between them, and the objective survives
//! while the *progress* rots.
//!
//! So the controller never reads findings. It reads this: a **bounded** view
//! whose size does not grow with the project.
//!
//! Pure over [`Finding`] — no store, no LLM, no clock. Everything the caller
//! needs to vary (the watermark, the build it is comparing against, the
//! budget) is an input, so the whole thing is a table-driven unit test.
//!
//! ## The budget is the design
//!
//! [`DigestOptions::max_chars`] is a hard ceiling, and overflow **drops
//! sections and says so** ([`Digest::dropped`]) rather than growing. A digest
//! that scales with the project rebuilds the exact problem this exists to
//! solve, and a cap that truncates silently reads as "nothing more to see" —
//! which is worse than an obviously-cut list.
//!
//! Chars, not tokens: this crate has no tokenizer and will not gain one for a
//! proxy. Callers holding a real budget should convert.
