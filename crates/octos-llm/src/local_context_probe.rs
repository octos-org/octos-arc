//! Probe a local server for its actual context window.
//!
//! The catalog rows for local families carry deliberately modest
//! `context_window` guesses (32K for `local`, similar for `ollama`/`vllm`)
//! because at registration time nothing knows what the operator launched.
//! But the running server DOES know: llama.cpp's `/props` reports the `-c`
//! value it was started with, and every OpenAI-compatible engine exposes
//! some spelling of the window on `GET /v1/models` (see
//! [`crate::local_discovery`]). Budgeting a 256K server as 32K is not a safe
//! under-estimate — the compaction loop shreds the working set to fit the
//! phantom limit, and long tasks degrade into re-read thrash (observed: a
//! 1,182-line source file read 66 times in one session while the live
//! context sat at ~19K of an actual 256K).
//!
//! [`LocalContextProbe`] wraps a local-family provider. The probe runs in
//! the background, spawned at construction when a runtime is available (so
//! a resumed long session gets the corrected window before its first
//! compaction pass, not after its first send), and re-attempted from the
//! request path otherwise. Outcomes are handled by kind, not collapsed:
//!
//! - the server ANSWERED and named a window → pinned;
//! - the server ANSWERED both endpoints without naming one → pinned as
//!   "no window", the catalog value stands (re-asking will not change it);
//! - the server was UNREACHABLE or mid-load (5xx, timeout) → NOT pinned:
//!   the next request retries, up to [`MAX_PROBE_ATTEMPTS`], because "the
//!   model was still loading during the first message" is precisely the
//!   session that needs the correction later.
//!
//! `context_window()` is sync and never blocks: the inner (catalog) value
//! before the probe lands, the server's truth after. Probe requests carry
//! the configured API key (llama-server / vLLM `--api-key` deployments are
//! exactly the ones that would otherwise 401) and honor the configured HTTP
//! connect timeout (a GPU box over a slow tunnel is exactly the deployment
//! most likely to run a large `-c`).
