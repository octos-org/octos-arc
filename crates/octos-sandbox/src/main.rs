//! octos-sandbox: platform sandbox helper binary.
//!
//! On Windows, creates/reuses an AppContainer profile and launches a command
//! inside it with restricted filesystem and network access. On Linux, applies
//! a Landlock filesystem policy plus a seccomp denylist before execing the
//! command.
//!
//! Usage:
//!   octos-sandbox --profile octos.dspfac --cwd C:\work \
//!     --allow-read C:\tools --allow-network \
//!     -- cmd /C "echo hello"
//!
//! On other platforms, this binary is a no-op passthrough.
