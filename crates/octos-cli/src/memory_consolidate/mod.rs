//! Memory consolidation engine (memory-refresh design, PR-4).
//!
//! Merges staging notes (`memory/staging/notes/`) and extraction files
//! (`memory/staging/extract/`) into `MEMORY.md` through ONE LLM merge call,
//! under machine-enforced authority gates: the model proposes ops, Rust
//! decides what is allowed based exclusively on host-written metadata.
//!
//! The engine is a leaf: everything arrives as parameters, all file IO stays
//! under the profile's memory directory. Wiring into schedulers/CLI lands in
//! a later integration PR (the PR-3 `memory_refresh` service is the caller).
//!
//! Run shape:
//! 1. load staging + MEMORY.md (INIT-migrate a legacy file in place);
//! 2. cancel expired pending-confirm notes (restore interim archives);
//! 3. skip early when there is nothing consumable — zero provider calls;
//! 4. bind free-text host forget notes to candidate entries (Rust-side);
//! 5. one `provider.chat()` (strict JSON; one corrective re-ask max);
//! 6. validate every op against the authority gates — any violation rejects
//!    the WHOLE merge, staging stays intact;
//! 7. apply in the sensitive-safe order (`apply.rs`), then delete consumed
//!    staging files.
