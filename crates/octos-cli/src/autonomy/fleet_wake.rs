//! Fleet-kernel outbox consumer → keeper wake (PR 4a).
//!
//! A background consumer that claims durable [`octos_fleet`] outbox events
//! (`ChildDone` / `FleetDrained`) and turns each into a **keeper
//! continuation** on the fleet's controller session — reusing the same
//! pull-model wake machinery (`MasterContinuationScheduler`) that
//! `GoalContinue` and `peer_fleet_synthesis` already ride.
//!
//! ## Shape: testable core + thin loop
//!
//! [`drain_fleet_outbox_once`] is a pure, singleton-free core: it takes the
//! store, a `now` clock (refreshed per claim), a per-tick batch cap, and a
//! `commit_wake` callback, so tests drive it against a fresh
//! [`MasterContinuationScheduler`] + a tempdir store.
//! [`spawn_fleet_outbox_consumer`] is the process loop; it calls
//! [`crate::autonomy::agent_orchestrator::InProcessAgentOrchestrator::drain_fleet_outbox`],
//! which supplies a `commit_wake` closure that locks the runtime state **only**
//! for the synchronous enqueue+persist — the async store I/O never runs under
//! the `std::sync::Mutex` guard.
//!
//! ## Durability (never lose a wake)
//!
//! The commit callback routes the wake through the SAME durable-persist path
//! the peer/goal wakes use, and the core acks an outbox event **only** once its
//! wake is [`WakeCommit::Durable`] (persisted, or a duplicate of an
//! already-recorded occurrence). A wake that is only in-memory (no supervisor
//! store) or whose persist failed is [`WakeCommit::NotDurable`]: the event is
//! left claimed and redelivers after the lease lapses, so a crash between the
//! in-memory enqueue and the controller draining it can never drop the wake.
//!
//! ## Dormant-but-correct (PR 4a scope)
//!
//! Nothing writes live fleet events until a later PR, so this consumer is inert
//! in production today; it is proven with synthetic events in the unit tests
//! below. It wakes a keeper whose workspace is already loaded (an interactive /
//! connected goal session); headless rehydration is PR 4b.
