//! Draft client/runtime protocol types for M9.
//!
//! This module intentionally captures only the first protocol slice needed to
//! align client and server work. A first WebSocket server slice now handles
//! session open, turn start, turn interrupt, approval, diff preview, and
//! task-output read requests. The full protocol model also defines harness
//! task-control requests so clients can target a stable AppUI contract while
//! backend support lands behind capabilities.
