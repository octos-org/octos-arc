/// `octos gateway` run as separate processes that bootstrap

/// `EpisodeStore::open` against the same path. The first opener (the
/// long-lived `octos serve` daemon) wins; the second opener (`octos
/// gateway` subprocesses) previously crashed with
/// `redb::DatabaseError::DatabaseAlreadyOpen` ("Database already
/// open. Cannot acquire lock."), launchd restarted it, and the cycle
/// repeated every ~2 seconds.
///
/// To prevent that crashloop without sacrificing serve-mode
/// persistence, [`EpisodeStore::open_or_degraded`] falls back to a
/// **degraded** in-memory store when the redb file is already locked:
/// `db` is `None`, all mutating operations silently no-op, and all
/// public read operations return empty. Callers that need to observe
/// the degradation (logging, metrics) can read [`Self::is_degraded`].
///
/// Two opener entry points formalize the role split:
/// - [`Self::open`] (strict) — fails when the lock is already held.
///   The right choice for the process that *must* own the canonical
///   store (`octos serve`, `octos chat`, the test suite). Surfaces
///   deployment misconfigurations as errors instead of silently
///   degrading the canonical writer.
/// - [`Self::open_or_degraded`] — falls back to the degraded handle
///   on lock contention. The right choice for `octos gateway`
///   subprocesses (and other companion processes) that should keep
///   going when the canonical store is owned elsewhere.
///
/// This split prevents the gateway-starts-first dev workflow from
/// flipping canonical ownership to gateway and degrading serve.
///
/// Episode reads on the gateway path are best-effort already
/// (memory-bank recall happens through the in-process `MemoryStore`,
